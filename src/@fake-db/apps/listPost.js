So you would like to display You hard work from medium on your personal website? I’m here to help You!</p>\n<p>In this project of ours, we are going to write HTML, CSS(SCSS), JavaScript. The plan is simple, so let’s get to work!</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>“Download” all content from a profile.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Transfer it to JSON.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Filter for only actual blog posts.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Properly display on Your website!</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That will be easy peasy lemon squeezy!</p>\n<p>On our journey, we are <strong>not </strong>going to use any JavaScript library or framework.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*ZkIJ5GT8OI71fXh09yCScQ.jpeg\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://imgflip.com/memegenerator\">https://imgflip.com/memegenerator</a></figcaption></figure><h3>1. Getting our hand on the content!</h3>\n<p>Currently, Medium’s API doesn’t offer a way to access our content in JSON format. All we get is this dirty XML, which is not going to help us a lot.</p>\n<p>But we it’s better than nothing, right? So to see all Your writings(comments and posts) we need to do the following:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/feed/@KonradDaWo\">https://medium.com/feed/@</a>YOUR_USERNAME_GOES_HERE</p>\n<p>That’s all. Easy, right?</p>\n<h3>2. Transform your hard work into lovely JSON format.</h3>\n<p>Here comes our hero! <a href=\"https://rss2json.com/\">rss2json.com</a> offers a nice and easy to use API to fulfill all of our needs in this case. (It’s not an advertisement)</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid! Even if You don’t know a thing about working with JSON, it’s not a problem..for this work at least :).</p>\n<p>To get something from API, in most cases you need to give something first (almost like real life, right?). In This case, we just need to give the link from our Medium feed in XML. Just like below.</p>\n<p>https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=https://medium.com/feed/@YOUR_USERNAME_STILL_GOES_HERE</p>\n<p>But the work isn’t done yet. Now we go to the fun part. Code!</p>\n<p>We are going to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\"><strong>Fetch API</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c9faaf7c37824c17ac3344819d5f71e6/href\">https://medium.com/media/c9faaf7c37824c17ac3344819d5f71e6/href</a><p><em>What we could do to make our code better, is check, if we have connected to API with a simple if(status == “ok”), so if it fails, we can display a nice error message. But it’s not necessary here.</em></p>\n<p>Now we are ready to do anything we want with our data!</p>\n<h3>3. Extract those sweet posts from this mess.</h3>\n<p>So, the response that we got is an array of content that we published on Medium.</p>\n<p>It’s either a comment or a post. Each of those two carries info about the author, publish date, tags, thumbnail, content etc.. Looks something like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/536/1*x-mxEMxNNUvr_-vmc3McCw.png\"><figcaption>x-mind mindmap. Great software for mindmaps</figcaption></figure><p>Now we have to separate our posts from the rest of the response’s items that we got from the API. We can use an easy trick to do this.</p>\n<p>Following.. each item has categories, BUT! it’s <strong>always </strong>an empty array of categories when the item is a comment. So it’s nothing harder than just filter the whole response array from items, where categories == array.length &gt; 0. Let’s do this!</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ce9fdba2d014a7129030052e03a12b89/href\">https://medium.com/media/ce9fdba2d014a7129030052e03a12b89/href</a><p>Yay! We are almost done.</p>\n<p><strong>First, we plan, then we code.</strong></p>\n<p>If we want to have a card-looking thingy presenting our blog post we need to create an Array of HTML nodes, each of them with our blog post containing our name, title, content, pubDate etc. something like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/458/1*5t-PznHY4m6yQxikh7wooQ.png\"><figcaption>Screenshot from my website</figcaption></figure><p>We have to shorten our content because we probably don’t want to display the whole post on this little card :). If You don’t need this, You can skip to the beginning of the fourth part.</p>\n<p>You still there? Great, let’s continue our study. (We are going to have one more issue soon.)</p>\n<p>So, to shorten our content we need to transform it into plain text, without HTML tags so that we don’t get a massive<strong> </strong>heading in our preview!</p>\n<p>Manageable like this: Its kind of a chip/non-fancy way but hey! It will work on any browser.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/342839abd1606032525a1690eda74633/href\">https://medium.com/media/342839abd1606032525a1690eda74633/href</a><p>We will use this function later on. But let’s just check one little thing…</p>\n<p>Our node, in this case, starts with: “Photo by Ian Schneider on Unsplash(…)”</p>\n<p><strong>What is wrong? That is the caption of our thumbnail!</strong></p>\n<p>But fear not, we can deal with it. We have to shorten that node anyway.</p>\n<p>An easy <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice\"><strong>slice</strong></a><strong> </strong>method on our string(Array) and we are done.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c4ee9d13422e4c0ab2b79ea16463a564/href\">https://medium.com/media/c4ee9d13422e4c0ab2b79ea16463a564/href</a><p>Last step and we are done!</p>\n<h3>4. Display our masterpiece on a web page!</h3>\n<p>This task is nothing harder than creating a variable that will store all of our HTML with blog posts and than putting it inside our document.</p>\n<p>So we create an empty output variable, go through our posts array and on our way we insert an HTML template with hooks: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\">${item.WHATEVER}</a> (more about this syntax called “template operators” <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\"><strong>here</strong></a>)to the content.</p>\n<p>What’s important is to use <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp\">“+=” operator</a>. We want to add new and keep previously added content to our variable and not only add and throw the old content away.</p>\n<p>In the end, we select our output container and just stuff it with our beautiful content.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/88dd890b7b394c97aee0cb0ed3f6aac1/href\">https://medium.com/media/88dd890b7b394c97aee0cb0ed3f6aac1/href</a><p>That’s the whole code.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing with You a link to a <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Konrad29/pen/ZoQRoz\">Codepen </a>where I added some HTML and SCSS to it, so You can see our whole work in action and a full presence!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/Konrad29/pen/ZoQRoz\">https://codepen.io/Konrad29/pen/ZoQRoz</a></p>\n<p>Thank a lot for reading, I hope it helped You with Your issue.</p>\n<p>Have a wonderful day!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=865507848c2\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

It’s not only a lot of fun and a great possibility to learn but it’s also an as productive hobby as reading books.</p>\n<p>I mean, who would want to have an own great audience that will listen and give back feedback on your thoughts?</p>\n<p>Therefore, I would love to tell you few reasons why I think that blogging is a great hobby.</p>\n<h3>It will make You a better person.</h3>\n<p>Writing down your thoughts is always a good method to analyze your current mindset and see eventual mistakes. Trust me, you will be surprised how much You can uncover Your personality.</p>\n<h4>If You follow a specific method of writing, you will improve Your Willpower.</h4>\n<p>For example, I sit down every day, at the same time and write for at least 45 minutes a day in a absolute silence, before I even start my real work. This is a really interesting feeling to just let your mind go bananas and write whatever comes to your mind.</p>\n<p>I have to admit, it’s not that easy to write!<br>The school really kills creativity, in my opinion, pupils are almost never rewarded for being creative. That’s just the industrial system that was supposed to get us ready for industrial work, doing the same thing over and over again without overthinking.</p>\n<p>I’m not against the school, but subjects like music or art should be introduced to our kids, after all, we are all creative when we are born, don’t we? Then why do so many people admit lack of creativity when they get older?</p>\n<p><strong>Halt!</strong><br>I’m getting too far with it, it’s a topic for another blog post (writes down a reminder)</p>\n<p>What I wanted to say is that we are mostly used to write on specific topics that were introduced to us and studied or at least explained. Blogging is different, you need Your own ideas, and that’s beautiful.</p>\n<h3>You will improve Your speech and more.</h3>\n<p>Writing a kind of well-constructed post without repeating and with organized thoughts-ladder is hard but worth it. I can imagine that gaining this skill will be really useful in Your future life, whether You try to implement it during a conversation or utilize it when writing a report for Your boss or a love-letter for Your wife.</p>\n<p>There are many hacks that can help You with this task!</p>\n<p>Templates or guides on “how to write” are pretty popular on Medium and in my opinion, if You want to learn this skill, you have to actually work for it.</p>\n<p>But what do I know? Stephen King’s word will have a bigger impact.</p>\n<blockquote>“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.”<br>― Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</blockquote>\n<h3>You may actually help people</h3>\n<p>That’s really thrilling when it comes to writing. A lot of people may find the experience that You share interesting or useful. They come to you, to read what you have to say about certain topic because they need this information, so why would you be so selfish?</p>\n<p>Just share your mistakes and thoughts!</p>\n<p>Who knows, maybe You can change somebody’s life, make their day better, find a way to pick a girl they really like or change profession and find happiness?</p>\n<blockquote>Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enrich your own life, as well.<br>― Stephen King</blockquote>\n<h3>It’s free, give it a try!</h3>\n<p>Pick Your subject, pick your niche or don’t pick anything. Just write down what comes to Your mind and let it go to the web. Who knows, maybe You will find Your new passion?</p>\n<h3>What I’m trying to say is…</h3>\n<p>You have nothing to lose here. Invest two hours and let Your imagination flow.</p>\n<p>If I could force people to try two things in their lives, I would pick Yoga and blogging.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.

It’s not only a lot of fun and a great possibility to learn but it’s also an as productive hobby as reading books.</p>\n<p>I mean, who would want to have an own great audience that will listen and give back feedback on your thoughts?</p>\n<p>Therefore, I would love to tell you few reasons why I think that blogging is a great hobby.</p>\n<h3>It will make You a better person.</h3>\n<p>Writing down your thoughts is always a good method to analyze your current mindset and see eventual mistakes. Trust me, you will be surprised how much You can uncover Your personality.</p>\n<h4>If You follow a specific method of writing, you will improve Your Willpower.</h4>\n<p>For example, I sit down every day, at the same time and write for at least 45 minutes a day in a absolute silence, before I even start my real work. This is a really interesting feeling to just let your mind go bananas and write whatever comes to your mind.</p>\n<p>I have to admit, it’s not that easy to write!<br>The school really kills creativity, in my opinion, pupils are almost never rewarded for being creative. That’s just the industrial system that was supposed to get us ready for industrial work, doing the same thing over and over again without overthinking.</p>\n<p>I’m not against the school, but subjects like music or art should be introduced to our kids, after all, we are all creative when we are born, don’t we? Then why do so many people admit lack of creativity when they get older?</p>\n<p><strong>Halt!</strong><br>I’m getting too far with it, it’s a topic for another blog post (writes down a reminder)</p>\n<p>What I wanted to say is that we are mostly used to write on specific topics that were introduced to us and studied or at least explained. Blogging is different, you need Your own ideas, and that’s beautiful.</p>\n<h3>You will improve Your speech and more.</h3>\n<p>Writing a kind of well-constructed post without repeating and with organized thoughts-ladder is hard but worth it. I can imagine that gaining this skill will be really useful in Your future life, whether You try to implement it during a conversation or utilize it when writing a report for Your boss or a love-letter for Your wife.</p>\n<p>There are many hacks that can help You with this task!</p>\n<p>Templates or guides on “how to write” are pretty popular on Medium and in my opinion, if You want to learn this skill, you have to actually work for it.</p>\n<p>But what do I know? Stephen King’s word will have a bigger impact.</p>\n<blockquote>“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.”<br>― Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</blockquote>\n<h3>You may actually help people</h3>\n<p>That’s really thrilling when it comes to writing. A lot of people may find the experience that You share interesting or useful. They come to you, to read what you have to say about certain topic because they need this information, so why would you be so selfish?</p>\n<p>Just share your mistakes and thoughts!</p>\n<p>Who knows, maybe You can change somebody’s life, make their day better, find a way to pick a girl they really like or change profession and find happiness?</p>\n<blockquote>Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enrich your own life, as well.<br>― Stephen King</blockquote>\n<h3>It’s free, give it a try!</h3>\n<p>Pick Your subject, pick your niche or don’t pick anything. Just write down what comes to Your mind and let it go to the web. Who knows, maybe You will find Your new passion?</p>\n<h3>What I’m trying to say is…</h3>\n<p>You have nothing to lose here. Invest two hours and let Your imagination flow.</p>\n<p>If I could force people to try two things in their lives, I would pick Yoga and blogging.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S. Thanks for reading, have a great day!</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6efae8a9ee0e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",
